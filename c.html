    <h3 style="text-align:center;">AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>    My name is Viena Delos Reyes Malapit, a 19-year-old dreamer, I was born in the beautiful province of Oriental Mindoro on the 21st day of October year 2001, I stayed there until I reach the age of 4. My mother is Nerissa D. Malapit who’s from Mindoro and my father is Victoriano M. Malapit Jr. who is from Pangasinan, they met abroad and decided to build a family together, that is why I’m here and my brother Vienrei D. Malapit. Our family is composed of only four members, but still I’m very lucky and blessed.
            Growing up, having a farmer father partnered with a housewife, we are living the simplest kind of life, sometimes on the farm always outside the house. I always love playing and being with friends that is why I also love sports and arts, whether it may be me watching or I’m the one who’s doing the work. When I got older, some things have changed, that is when I view the world from different perspective, I realized that people aren’t always as good as you expected. From being the little girl who loves to play outside and being with people to a teenager who loves her solitude.
            I am one of those children who’s not certain on their dream, I started schooling at Babasit Elementary School, back then, when asked “What do you want to be when you grow up?” I would always say that I want to be a nurse or a doctor someday, in high school at Reiland Christian School Inc. that is when my dream started to change, when I met a teacher who was an engineer, I stayed at that school for two years then I continued my schooling in Manaoag National High School, my dream to be an engineer continued, as the years passed I am certain that I want to be a Civil Engineer, until Senior high school years, where I took the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Strand, I was eager to achieve my dream. There are times where I stop and cry, thinking why I need to go through this, why do I want this, perhaps having breakdown, but still my determination is unmetered. In college I was supposed to take up Civil Engineering, but my destiny says not, now I am studying at the Pangasinan State University dreaming to be a Computer Engineer. I know that God led me here, so I’m here to take the challenge. 
            I have so many dreams in life, and I’m continuously dreaming, I always think about the phrase I heard from an interview of the former Sen. Lauren Legarda where she says, “Hold fast to dreams, for if dream die, life is like a broken winged bird that cannot fly” it was from the poem of Langston Hughes, it conveys a message that people shouldn’t stop dreaming for them to continue living with a purpose, and that’s what I want to do with mine.
